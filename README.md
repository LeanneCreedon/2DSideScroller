This is a project I worked on in summer of 2021 with the help of Brackeys Unity tutorials on YouTube.

## About

There are three simple levels to complete

You play as a squirrel and you must make it back home. There are diamonds to collect. And you can regain health by picking up hearts.
There are enemies to avoid such as the eagle chasing you and the frogs getting in your way.
